# SingleCell_Toroid
Single Cell to whole brain fMRI dataset from Toroid
In order to access the dataset, you will need to utilize Google Drive. You should have recieved a shared Drive folder entitled Toroid Images. For your ease of access, the link to the files are also here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11Zu0iwT3ajbOnaEZFG0D8Y7V5CwLDoWn?usp=sharing.
Once your Google account is able to access the folder and it is in your shared files, you can then proceed to mount your Drive account to the code. This will then ask you to click a link which will provide to you an access code, which you will paste into the box. 
Once you provide the access/authorization code, you should see an output that states you have mounted to Drive. After this you should be able to navigate the script!
